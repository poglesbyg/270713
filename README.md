# AI Junior Developer Team Manager

A command-line tool for managing a team of AI developers to work on your projects.

## Features

- **Team Configuration**: Specify how many AI developers you want (1-10)
- **Project Assignment**: Point the team to any project directory with a description
- **Smart Task Distribution**: Automatically distributes tasks based on developer specializations
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Monitor what each AI developer is working on
- **Project Analysis**: Analyzes project structure and technologies to optimize task assignment

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Start the interactive CLI:

```bash
npm start
```

Or for development with auto-reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## How It Works

1. **Configure Team**: Choose how many AI developers you want (each gets a specialization like Frontend, Backend, DevOps, etc.)
2. **Assign Project**: Provide a project directory path and describe what you want built
3. **Start Development**: The AI team analyzes your project and starts working with distributed tasks
4. **Monitor Progress**: View real-time status of each developer and their current tasks

## Developer Specializations

- **Frontend**: UI/UX, React components, styling, responsive design
- **Backend**: APIs, databases, authentication, server logic
- **Full-Stack**: Project setup, integration, core workflows
- **DevOps**: CI/CD, deployment, monitoring, infrastructure
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, test automation
- **Security**: Security measures, vulnerability assessment
- **Database**: Schema design, query optimization, migrations
- **Mobile**: Mobile app development, native features

## Architecture
